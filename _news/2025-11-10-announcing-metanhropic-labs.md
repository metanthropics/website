Today, we are thrilled to announce the launch of **METANTHROPIC **, an independent research organization founded by <br>
***Mr. Ekjot Singh.***

***Mr. Singh*** will serve as the lab's ***Founder, Director, and Lead Researcher***, guiding its mission to ***build safe and broadly beneficial Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).***

At **METANTHROPIC,** our core thesis is that the path to AGI lies in the development and deep understanding of increasingly capable and general models. Our research agenda is centered on scaling these systems, architecting novel approaches for large-scale models, and pushing the frontier of fundamental capabilities in reasoning, multimodality, and reinforcement learning.

The development of powerful AI presents immense opportunities but also necessitates a profound technical commitment to safety. Our work on AI alignment and interpretability is not an adjunct effort but is integrated directly into our core research. We will conduct rigorous, empirical analysis to understand and mitigate potential risks, ensuring our models are robust, predictable, and aligned with human values.
