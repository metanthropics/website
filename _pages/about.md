**Our mission is to build safe and broadly beneficial *Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).***

We are an ***Independent Research Company*** focused on solving intelligence. Our core thesis is that the path to ***AGI*** lies in the development and deep understanding of increasingly capable and general models. Our research agenda is centered on scaling these systems, architecting novel approaches for large-scale models, and pushing the frontier of fundamental capabilities in reasoning, multimodality, and reinforcement learning.

The development of powerful AI presents immense opportunities but also necessitates a profound technical commitment to safety. Our work on AI alignment and interpretability is not an adjunct effort but is integrated directly into our core research.
***We conduct rigorous, empirical analysis to understand and mitigate potential risks, ensuring our models are robust.***
