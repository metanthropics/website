        <p><strong>Founder & Lead Researcher, Metanthropic</strong></p>

        <p>Ekjot Singh is the Founder and Lead Researcher of Metanthropic, a multidisciplinary research lab dedicated to developing safe and broadly beneficial Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). He leads the lab's core mission, which is centered on the thesis that solving AGI requires a holistic understanding of intelligence, complex systems, and strategic reasoning.</p>

        <p>Mr. Singh's research integrates foundational AI safety, reinforcement learning, and scalable systems architecture with a wide spectrum of quantitative and strategic disciplines. The lab's research program synthesizes insights from these diverse fields, believing that principles from areas like computational finance and economics are essential for building robust and aligned AI.</p>

        <p>Metanthropic's primary research areas include:</p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Core AI & Systems:</strong> AI Safety, Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, and the principles of scalable and robust model architectures.</li>
        <li><strong>Foundational Sciences:</strong> Applied Mathematics and Physics.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantitative Finance & Economics:</strong> Research spanning computational finance, trading and market microstructure, and statistical/mathematical finance.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Strategic Reasoning:</strong> Analysis of decision-making frameworks informed by private equity and M&A.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As a software engineer focused on large-scale systems, Mr. Singh's work is centered on architecting the next generation of AI models by leveraging this unique, cross-disciplinary synthesis. He is focused on ensuring the path to AGI is navigated with a profound technical commitment to safety and alignment.</p>
